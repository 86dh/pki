== Message Format Changes ==

Prior to version 11 PKI mostly supported REST API in XML format,
although there were endpoints that supported JSON as well.
Starting from version 11 PKI will only support REST API in JSON format.

In most cases users using the REST API indirectly via CLI or Web UI should not be affected.
However, PKI tools that used to take or produce an XML file will now take or produce a JSON file instead.
